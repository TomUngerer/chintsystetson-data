      "There was a woman who wore a juicy couture tracksuit, with the rhinestones on the back. She paid for the suite every Friday night. She sold drugs in bin liners and sat on the floor by the bar. She disappeared 2 years ago. I call the hotel every now and then but they say they’ve never seen her before.",
      "I called her Chintzy. She called me Stetson."
